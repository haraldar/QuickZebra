# QuickZebra
A C# class library (dll) for creating ZPL code from C# code. Written to work with at least labelary. There are 2 different approaches with the same result in this library.

---

### 1 - The QuickZebra.Absolute namespace

This namespace works with absolute positional values.

Progress stage: Almost done.

---

### 2 - The QuickZebra.Relative namespace

This namespace works with relative reverese engineered values and allows for a more schematic approach, just as one would do when working with HTML or XML/XAML.

Progress stage: A thought and a work in progress.
